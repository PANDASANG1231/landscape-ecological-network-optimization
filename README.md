# Landscape Ecological Network Optimization

It is a research project in landscape network analysis. In the repository, we try to research on two problems

## Topics:

- [X] 1.Calculating network probable connectivity indexes of different network connection modes derived from "Network Connection Additional Technique" using python and networkX.
- [X] 2. Visualization of existing network and network with optimized structure.
- [X] 3. Dynamic Programming on the network with optimized structure and find the best paths for each additional links under hierarchical multi-objective rules.
